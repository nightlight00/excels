~ EXCELSIOR ~ 

Excelsior is a mod who's focus is to fill in what we feel is missing from the base game, while exploring or own concepts as well.
It features 200+ items, 3 new bosses, and a new Class : The Cleric.
The Cleric has two sides to it, the life-consuming dps : Necrotic and the healer : Radiant.  Each have their differences but work best when used together


List of Major content in the mod : 
- New class : Cleric Class
- 3 new bosses 
- 1 new town npc
- 90+ new weapons
- 10+ new healing tools
- 12 new armor sets
- 20+ new accessories
- 7 new ammunitions
- new worldgen
- 1 custom music track
