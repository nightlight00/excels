[b]~ EXCELSIOR ~[/b] 

Excelsior is a mod who's focus is to fill in what we feel is missing from the base game, while exploring or own concepts as well.
It features 200+ items, 3 new bosses, and a new Class : [b]The Cleric[/b].
The Cleric has two sides to it, the life-consuming dps : Necrotic and the healer : Radiant.  Each have their differences but work best when used together


List of Major content in the mod : 
- New class : Cleric Class
- 3 new bosses 
- 2 new town npcs
- 100+ new weapons
- 20+ healing tools
- 12 new armor sets
- 25+ new accessories
- 8 new ammunitions
- new worldgen
- 1 custom music track
